## <a id="HReason"></a>Reason for applying for a job 

I received my basic education in the field of tourism and worked in it for a long time. I liked my job, but information technology has changed tourism, many clients have switched to self-planning their travels. Over the past few years, I have become interested in information technology. And I realized that IT for me is a new promising opportunity for constant self-development, realization of my abilities and professional growth.
